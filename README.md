### Introduction
Image sequences or video fusion is a very important application in practical terms. Efficiency is critical because up to 30 merged images are generated every second which precludes the use of some algorithms that work well on still images, most importantly many of the multi-scale approaches.

### The Goal
This program was created to extract video into frames with the aim of turning the video into a dataset in a camera calibration project

### How to Use

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/Herusyahputra/Sequence-Video-Frame.git
  ```
  ```
  $ cd Sequence-Video-Frame
  ```
  ```
  $ python3 sequence.py
  ```

### Result

you can see in folder save/video/
